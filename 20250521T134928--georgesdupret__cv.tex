\section{\centerline{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}} 

\vspace{8pt} % Gap between title and text

% -------------------------------------------------- SPOTIFY

{\sl \textbf{Spotify, Boston, Massachusetts, USA}} \hfill November 2021 -- Present \\
Principal Scientist 

\vspace{8pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item I spearheaded a ground-up initiative to develop innovative
  model-free methods for strategic decision-making using historical
  data. My efforts involved evangelizing the concept and actively
  seeking out collaborators to drive adoption and implementation,
  resulting in its increasing use at the highest levels of the
  company~\cite{dupret2024fortune}.
\item Promote and coordinate efforts to implement advanced Large
  Language Model methods to assess the quality of music playlists (LLM
  as a Judge) before their release, ensuring high production
  standards. Develop a Minimum Viable Product to showcase the
  technology, and coordinate various production teams to scale the
  application for use in Tableau reporting and as a support tool for
  editors and annotators.
\item Established a research team to investigate the application of
  Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) studies in A/B experiments. The
  analyses generated by HTE are typically unstable and challenging to
  interpret. We overcame these obstacles, significantly enhancing the
  tool's usability and accessibility for non-specialists.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------------------------------- APPLE

{\sl \textbf{Apple, Cupertino, California, USA}} \hfill September 2017 -- November 2021 \\
Principal Scientist in Maps Organization working on Ranking, Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

I was part of the team responsible for the search engine powering
address and business searches in Apple Maps. While collaborating on
ongoing maintenance and enhancements with the team, I also
lead several individual initiatives:

\vspace{8pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item Debugging issues within a large and complex system posed
  significant challenges. A notable difficulty with the learning
  algorithm was determining the contribution of different features in
  ranking items. We leveraged Shapley values as a principled solution,
  which we extended to effectively compare result pairs.
\item With the rise of deep learning at that time, we investigated its
  application to improve search rankings. We developed the initial MVP
  for a search system that efficiently utilized embeddings, making it
  suitable for production.
\item Considering the critical role of physical distance in map search,
  along with user implicit feedback, I developed innovative features and
  data structures tailored to address map topology and the high
  dimensionality inherent in user feedback.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------------------------------- FULLPOWER

  diagnosis of heart conditions using AliveCor's FDA-approved
  electrocardiogram device.

\item Reorganized the entire codebase in C\texttt{++} to prioritize testing and
  reproducibility, ensuring compliance with FDA standards.

\item Created tools using R Shiny for efficient triaging of
  misdiagnosed ECG cases.

\item Engineered specialized algorithms for signal filtering, beat
  classification, and pathology detection.

\item Defined priorities and set the agenda for the Science Team in
  collaboration with Project Managers to align with organizational
  goals.
\end{itemize}

{\sl \textbf{Yahoo! Labs, Sunnyvale, California, USA}} \hfill October 2008 -- December 2014 \\
Senior Scientist, Machine Learned Ranking Group

\vspace{8pt} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed and optimized Web and Vertical Search ranking
  algorithms utilizing click-through data analysis, leading to new
  interpretations that enhanced search engine results globally. This
  work earned a Best Paper Award at WSDM2010.
  
\item Innovated user engagement metrics across Yahoo properties,
  balancing revenue generation with improved user experience through
  localized and global metrics.
  
\item Designed computationally efficient methods for query
  recommendations, improving the relevance and efficiency of search
  results.
  
\item Advanced the ranking algorithm's sensitivity to document
  recency, boosting the freshness and relevance of search outputs.
\end{itemize}

{\sl \textbf{Yahoo! Research Latin America, Santiago, Chile}} \hfill March 2006 -- October 2008 \\
Researcher

\vspace{8pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed novel evaluation metrics for structured documents
  using principled user model assumptions.
  
\item Managed and supervised multiple dissertations and master's
  theses, contributing to academic and professional advancements in
  the field of web research.
